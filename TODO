MUST:
- support ipv6
  half done: not tested yet, just compiles.
  check for bind_h: must be same proto as dst_h (both v4 or both v6!)
- v6ize verbose outputs
- daemonize
- syslog
- if compiled with -O2, gcc mangles the dst sockaddr_in pointers in some weird ways

MAYBE:
- ctrl client to view current "sessions", refresh etc
- config file
- support multiple different setups with one process
